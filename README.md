# ü§ñ Akuma (Old Personal Assistant)

Akuma is a **voice-controlled AI assistant** I built a long time ago as one of my early Python projects.  
It uses libraries like `speech_recognition`, `pyttsx3`, `wikipedia`, `wolframalpha`, and others to respond to voice commands, search online, open apps, and even tell jokes.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer:**  
This is an **old project** (created years ago) and is uploaded here for **archival and learning purposes**.  
Many features, APIs, and email credentials used in this code will **not work** today without updates.  
Use this as a reference, not a production-ready assistant.
