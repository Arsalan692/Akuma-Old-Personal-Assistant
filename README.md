# Akuma-Old-Personal-Assistant
🖥️ A very old Python-based voice assistant I built years ago using pyttsx3, speech_recognition, wolframalpha, wikipedia, and other libraries. It can tell jokes, send emails, open Chrome, play music, search the web, and more — but many features may no longer work due to outdated APIs and dependencies.
